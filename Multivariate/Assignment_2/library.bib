abstract = {The validity of clinical diagnoses is a fundamental topic in clinical psychology, because now there are some political administrations, as the IOM or the U.K. government, which are focusing on best evidence-based practice in clinical psychology. The most problematic issue in clinical psychology is to avoid wrong diagnoses which can have negative consequences on individual life and on the utility of clinical treatments. In the case of diagnoses based on self-report tests, the diagnostic decision about individual health is based on the comparison between its score and the cutoff, according to the frequentist approach to probability. However, the frequentist approach underestimates the possible risks of incorrect diagnoses based on cutoffs only. The Bayesian approach is a valid alternative to make diagnoses on the basis of the scores from psychological tests. The Bayes' theorem estimates the posterior probability of the presence of a pathology on the basis of the knowledge about the diffusion of this pathology (prior probability) and of the knowledge of sensitivity and specificity values of the test. With all this information, it is possible to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of some self-report tests used for assessing depression. We analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of the most used psychological tests of depression (Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Center for Epidemiological Studies for Depression and the Beck Depression Inventory), together with a new scale (Teate Depression Inventory) developed with the IRT procedure, by analyzing the published works in which data about sensitivity and specificity of these scales are reported. Except the TDI, none of these scales can reach a satisfactory level of diagnostic accuracy, probably for the absence of an optimal procedure to select test items and subjects with clearly defined pathological symptoms which could allow the reduction of false positives in test scoring.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 INFORMS. The lives of U.S. soldiers in combat depend on complex weapon systems and advanced technologies. In combat conditions, the resources available to support the operation and maintenance of these systems are minimal. Following the failure of a critical system, technical support personnel may take days to arrive via helicopter or ground convoy-leaving soldiers and civilian experts exposed to battlefield risks. To address this problem, the U.S. Army Communications Electronics Command (CECOM) developed a suite of systems, Virtual Logistics Assistance Representative (VLAR), with a single purpose: to enable a combat soldier to maintain critical equipment. The CECOM VLAR team uses an operations research (OR) approach to codifying expert knowledge about Army equipment and applying that knowledge to troubleshooting equipment diagnostics in combat situations. VLAR infuses a classic knowledge-management spiral with OR techniques: from socializing advanced technical concepts and eliciting tacit knowledge, to integrating expert knowledge, to creating an intuitive and instructive interface, and finally, to making VLAR a part of a soldier's daily life. VLAR is changing the Army's sustainment paradigm by creating an artificial intelligence capability and applying it to equipment diagnostics. In the process, it has generated a sustainable cost-savings model and a means to mitigate combat risk. Through 2015, VLAR saved the Army {\$}27 million in direct labor costs from an investment of {\$}8 million by reducing the requirement for technical support personnel.We project additional direct costs savings of {\$}222 million from an investment of {\$}60 million by the end of 2020. Most importantly, VLAR has prevented an estimated 4,500 casualties by reducing requirements for helicopter and ground-convoy movements. This translates to short- and long-term medical cost savings of over {\$}9 billion. In this paper, we discuss the OR methods that underpin VLAR, at the heart of which lie causal Bayesian networks, and we detail the process we use to translate scientific theory and experiential knowledge into accessible applications for equipment diagnostics.},

@article{Lax2009a,
abstract = {We compare two approaches for estimating state-level public opinion: disaggregation by state of national surveys and a simulation approach using multilevel modeling of individual opinion and poststratification by population share. We present the first systematic assessment of the predictive accuracy of each and give practical advice about when and how each method should be used. To do so, we use an original data set of over 100 surveys on gay rights issues as well as 1988 presidential election data. Under optimal conditions, both methods work well, but multilevel modeling performs better generally. Compared to baseline opinionmeasures, it yields smaller errors, higher correlations, and more reliable estimates. Multilevel modeling is clearly superior when samples are smaller—indeed, one can accurately estimate state opinion using only a single large national survey. This greatly expands the scope of issues for which researchers can study subnational opinion directly or as an influence on policymaking.},

We engage this literature by introducing new dimensions to existing theory for predicting the impact of Court decisions on public confidence in the Court and by introducing innovative methods to test our hypotheses. We begin our analysis by examining the relationship between specific Court decisions and public confidence with aggregate time series data. Our analysis then shifts to an examination of individual-level survey data to examine the same hypotheses. Our results indicate that specific decisions can have a significant positive and negative impact on individual-level confidence in the Court.

The task of creating Fraud-BNC was automatically performed by a Hyper-Heuristic Evolutionary Algorithm (HHEA), which organizes the knowledge about the BNC algorithms into a taxonomy and searches for the best combination of these components for a given dataset. Fraud-BNC was automatically generated using a dataset from PagSeguro, the most popular Brazilian online payment service, and tested together with two strategies for dealing with cost-sensitive classification. Results obtained were compared to seven other algorithms, and analyzed considering the data classification problem and the economic efficiency of the method. Fraud-BNC presented itself as the best algorithm to provide a good trade-off between both perspectives, improving the current company's economic efficiency in up to 72.64{\%}.},

@article{Epstein2010,
abstract = {Using qualitative data and historical methods, Barry Friedman asserts with confidence that “we the people” influence the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. Using quantitative data and statistical methods, political scientists are not so sure. Despite their best efforts to validate basic claims about the effect of public opinion on the Court, the evidence remains mixed at best. We enter this dialogue but in a voice distinct from existing political science work. Rather than explore the relationship between the public and the Court on a term-by-term basis, we analyze it at the level of the case. This allows us to exploit more nuanced public opinion data, as well as to attend to the many other case-level factors that may influence the Court's decisions. Based on our analysis, we are prepared to say that Professor Friedman is on to something. When the “mood of the public” is liberal (conservative), the Court is significantly more likely to issue liberal (conservative) decisions. But why is anyone's guess. Professor Friedman posits that the Justices will bend to the will of the people because the Court requires public support to remain an efficacious branch of government. Our analysis could be read to support this view, but it is equally consistent with another mechanism: that “the people” include the Justices. On this account, the Justices do not respond to public opinion directly, but rather respond to the same events or forces that affect the opinion of other members of the public. Our study proceeds as follows. In Part II, we briefly review the extant literature, emphasizing the similar methodology it invokes but the varying conclusions it reaches. Parts III and IV describe our methods and findings. We end, in Part V, with the implications of our statistical work for Professor Friedman's claims, as well as for future research assessing the Court's response to public opinion.},

Recent research indicates that, in addition to this indirect effect, Supreme Court justices respond directly to changes in public opinion. We explore the two causal pathways suggested to link public opinion directly to the behavior of justices and the implications of the nature and strength of these linkages for current debates concerning Supreme Court tenure. The recent increase in the stability of Court membership has raised questions about the continued efficiacy of the replacement mechanism and renewed debates over mechanisms to limit judicial tenure. Our analysis provides little evidence that justices respond strategically public opinion but provides partial support for the idea that justices' preferences shift in response to the same social forces that shape the opinions of thegeneral public. Our analysis offers preliminary evidence that - even in the absence of membership change - public opinoin may provide a mechanism by which the preferences of the Court can be aligned with those of the public.},

abstract = {Due to the growing volume of electronic payments, the monetary strain of credit-card fraud is turning into a substantial challenge for financial institutions and service providers, thus forcing them to continuously improve their fraud detection systems. However, modern data-driven and learning-based methods, despite their popularity in other domains, only slowly find their way into business applications. In this paper, we phrase the fraud detection problem as a sequence classification task and employ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to incorporate transaction sequences. We also integrate state-of-the-art feature aggregation strategies and report our results by means of traditional retrieval metrics. A comparison to a baseline random forest (RF) classifier showed that the LSTM improves detection accuracy on offline transactions where the card-holder is physically present at a merchant. Both the sequential and non-sequential learning approaches benefit strongly from manual feature aggregation strategies. A subsequent analysis of true positives revealed that both approaches tend to detect different frauds, which suggests a combination of the two. We conclude our study with a discussion on both practical and scientific challenges that remain unsolved.},

abstract = {Voter turnout in national elections continues to decline. Recent efforts to adopt a national initiative have raised the question of whether initiatives increase voter turnout on the assumption that specific issues attract voters to the polls. Previous research is inconclusive on the question. This study examines turnout in states which held initiatives versus states without initiatives in the years 1960-78. Examining all states, there is a modest turnout advantage for initiative states in both presidential and off-years. With the Southern states removed, however, that advantage is eliminated. It thus seems likely that other factors, such as political culture, account for the differences between initiative and non-initiative states. The conclusion is that while initiatives may have a positive impact on turnout in special circumstances, no general long-term positive impact is likely. Over a series of elections, a national initiative held at the time of general elections would not be expected to affect turnout significantly.},

In Elections and the Political Order, eds. A. Campbell, E E. Converse, W. E. Miller, and D. E. Stokes. New York: Wiley), we test whether ballot measures engage and mobilize people who do not fit the profile of regular voters. Using national opinion data from the 2004 and 2006 elections, we find that independents (relative to partisans) exhibited greater awareness of and interest in ballot measures in the midterm election. This pattern is not found in the presidential election, where peripheral voters are likely to be mobilized by the stimulus of the presidential race rather than by ballot measures. Absent salient ballot measures, some episodic independent voters may not be engaged by midterm elections. This suggests that some variation in midterm turnout maybe a function of peripheral voters becoming engaged by ballot measures. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

The use of these predictive scores has increased dramatically since 2004, and their use could yield sizable gains to campaigns that harness them. At the same time, their widespread use effectively creates a coordination game with incomplete information between allied organizations. As such, organizations would benefit from partitioning the electorate to not duplicate efforts, but legal and political constraints preclude that possibility.},

We examine whether issue content interacts with the interests and agendas of ‘‘issue publics,'' focusing on the relationship between campaign messages and the turnout of senior citizens, veterans, and parents. Our analysis matches Current Population Survey respondents to media markets and then to relevant campaign advertising data in the 1998, 2000, and 2002 elections. We find that issue-specific campaign messages are not associated with higher turnout among senior citizens or veterans and are associated with only a small increase in turnout among parents. Our results suggest that campaign effects vary in their magnitude and importance for the mobilization of issue publics.},

However, the inherent characteristics of streaming data, such as generated quickly, data infinite, tremendous volume and the phenomenon of concept drift, imply that the anomaly detection in the streaming data is a challenge work. In this paper, using the frame of sliding windows and taking into account the concept drift phenomenon, a novel anomaly detection framework is presented and an adapted streaming data anomaly detection algorithm based on the iForest algorithm, namely iForestASD is proposed. The experiment results performed on four real-world datasets derived from the UCI repository demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effective to detect anomalous instances for the streaming data.

abstract = {The theoretical and empirical debate over the ability of the U.S. Supreme Court to influence public opinion through its decisions is far from settled. Scholars have examined the question using a variety of theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence, but there is no theoretical consensus, nor are the empirical studies without methodological weaknesses. We enter this debate in an attempt to bring some clarity to the theoretical approaches, overcome some of the methodological shortcomings, and bring a yet unstudied issue area, Court decisions on gay civil rights, under scrutiny. We argue that the ability of Court decisions to influence public opinion is a function of the salience of the issue, the political context, and case specific factors at the aggregate level. At the individual level these factors are also relevant, but citizen characteristics must also be taken into consideration. Our analysis of aggregate level and individual level opinion does indeed suggest that Court decisions can influence public opinion. However, the ability of Court decisions to influence public opinion is conditional. Our findings lend support to the legitimation hypothesis and the structural effects model. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings and suggestions for future research.},

As enterprises often do not have the necessary know-how to implement analytics processes, analytics consultants support them in such projects. The problem for the consultants is that a standardised approach, which provides orientation and guidance during such projects, is currently not available. The goal of this paper is to develop a framework, which guides consultants in order to avoid common project-related problems. It is developed employing Design Science Research Methodology. Empirical data collection and iterative validation of the framework are based on literature research, document analysis, expert interviews and a focus group. Results highlight that it is useful to combine a capability maturity model and an analytics procedure model.

The Conditional Response Model holds that while elite actors can influence and polarize the public when they first act on an issue, subsequent action will not have this same effect. We challenge this model based on its depiction of psychological models of attitude formation and change. Instead of focusing on the number of times an actor has ad- dressed an issue, we argue that the state of public opinion is the key to determining how the public will react to multiple elite actions over a long timeframe. We examine how the public reacted to multiple Supreme Court decisions on abortion. Our results suggest that the Conditional Response Model does a poor job of depicting public opinion and that actors are not limited in their influence by the number of previous actions on an issue.},

Both models contend that decision making occurs laterally as state officials learn from or react to the policy decisions of other elites; the public has a minor role. I offer an additional explanation, the social contagion model, which suggests that state residents react to neighboring policies by changing their aggregate opinions on that policy. If state opinion becomes supportive, state officials respond by enacting similar policies in the home state or risk being ousted from office. Using both individual and aggregate data on antismoking legislation, I find empirical support for the social contagion model. The results reorient theories of policy diffusion to the public and, consequently, open up new avenues for future research.},

@article{Wlezien2005,
abstract = {Salience is an important concept throughout political science. Traditionally, the word has been used to designate the importance of issues, particularly for voters. To measure salience in political behavior research, scholars often rely on people's responses to the survey question that asks about the "most important problem" (MIP) facing the nation. In this manuscript, I argue that the measure confuses at least two different characteristics of salience: The importance of issues and the degree to which issues are a problem. It even may be that issues and problems are themselves fundamentally different things, one relating to public policy and the other to conditions. Herein, I conceptualize the different characteristics of MIP. I then undertake an empirical analysis of MIP responses over time in the US. It shows that most of the variation in MIP responses reflects variation in problem status. To assess whether these responses still capture meaningful information about the variation in importance over time, I turn to an analysis of opinion-policy dynamics, specifically on the defense spending domain. It shows that changes in MIP mentions do not structure public responsiveness to policy or policymaker responsiveness to public preferences themselves. Based on the results, it appears that the political importance of defense has remained largely unchanged over time. The same may be true in other domains. Regardless, relying on MIP responses as indicators of issue importance of any domain is fundamentally flawed. The responses may tell us something about the "prominence" of issues, but we simply do not know. The implication is clear: We first need to decide what we want to measure and then design the instruments to measure it. ?? 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

What is more, we stress the importance of anomaly {\{}$\backslash$em attribution{\}} and highlight the major techniques that facilitate digging out the root cause, or the `why', of the detected anomalies for further analysis and sense-making. Finally, we present several real-world applications of graph-based anomaly detection in diverse domains, including financial, auction, computer traffic, and social networks.

As a result, there has been virtually no study of whether legislators accurately represent the will of their constituents on individual issues. This article solves this problem by developing a multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) model that combines survey and census data to estimate public opinion at the district level. We show that MRP estimates are excellent predictors of public opinion and referenda results for both congressional and state senate districts. Moreover, they have less error, higher correlations, and lower variance than either disaggregated survey estimates or presidential vote shares. The MRP approach provides American and Comparative Politics scholars with a valuable new tool to measure issue-specific public opinion at low levels of geographic aggregation.},

Recent research on public opinion bolsters the connection between public preferences and policies enacted in the American states.

This study examines the hypothesis that public opinion influences abortion policies, and that public opinion and public policy both influence rates of abortion utilization by state publics. The findings suggest that public preferences have profound effects on the contours of abortion policy and access to abortion providers. There are equally significant links to abortion use, even when controlling for socioeconomic factors and religious orientations in the states.},

States vary in the kinds of records they collect from voters - and these variations in data across the country mean that campaigns perceive voters differently in different areas. Consequently, the strategies of campaigns and the coalitions of voters who are mobilized fluctuate across the country because of the different ways campaigns perceive the electorate.

abstract = {This article is a first attempt to develop and assess the competing predictions of the thermostatic model of public opinion and legitimation theory for the responses of public mood to Supreme Court decisions. While the thermostatic model predicts a negative relationship between the ideological direction of Supreme Court decisions and changes in public mood, legitimation theory predicts that changes in mood should be positively associated with the ideological content of the Court's actions. I assess these rival expectations by modeling the dynamic relationship between mood and cumulative judicial liberalism. The model estimates indicate a complex interaction between the Court and the mass public characterized by short-term backlash against Supreme Court decisions in mood followed by long-run movement toward the ideological positions taken by the Court. The results emphasize the legitimacy of the Court in American politics and point to a unique role for the Court in shaping public opinion. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Distinguishing between midterm and presidential years, the analysis tests for the effects of campaigns across those two kinds of contexts. Contrary to previous studies finding no effects at all for bailor initiatives, the results indicate that these measures-like gubernatorial and senatorial campaigns-provide boost to turnout during midterm years but not presidential years. High-salience initiatives and popular referenda are estimated to increase turnout by about four points during midterm elections, as compared to effects for closely contested gubernatorial and senatorial campaigns of lour points and three points, respectively.},

abstract = {This study presents an empirical test of the extent to which the "issue ownership" model explains the electoral decisions of individual voters. The model has been tested mainly by its ability to predict aggregate election results by issue salience (e.g., Budge and Farlie, 1983; Petrocik, 1996). Applications of the theory for explaining individual voting behavior were restricted to two-party systems. This study makes use of innovative survey questions contained in the Dutch Parliamentary Elections Study 1998, which allow for appropriate tests of the model in the context of multi-party systems. The results show that issue voting - indicated by the direct effect of issues salience on party preferences - occurs only to a very limited extent. However, evidence is found for an indirect effect of issue priorities on party preferences, which is mediated by ideology. By selectively emphasizing issues, a party may alter its ideological position. Since ideological proximity is the main determinant of party choice, changes in ideological positions make a party more attractive to some voters and less attractive to others. In the conclusions it is thus argued that the issue ownership model - which is mainly a model of party behavior - is compatible with ideological voting as conceptualized by Downs (1957) and which provides a good explanation of the behavior of voters. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Ltd.

Some of these, such as political parties or ideological orientations, are similar to those also found to be influential in elections. Others can be quite different. In some referendums, the issue may be entirely new and unfamiliar to many voters, initiating a ‘learning' or ‘cue–taking' process specific to the campaign itself. In referendum campaigns, parties may be internally divided and sometimes send conflicting signals to their electorates. As a result, voting behaviour in referendums often exhibits greater volatility than is found in elections. In the ten papers included in this Special Issue of EJPR, we focus on the process of opinion formation and change which occurred in a number of European, North American and Australia/New Zealand referendums held under a variety of different institutional and political conditions. In this essay, I argue that there are three distinctive patterns of opinion formation and reversal that tend to occur in referendum campaigns, each of which has significant consequences both for voting choice and for referendum outcomes.},

Yet fully a quarter century later, that theory remains the dominant paradigm for under- standing mass-elite linkage in politics. We present an alternative spatial theory of elec- tions that we argue has greater empirical verisimilitude. Based on the ideas of symbolic politics, the directional theory assumes that most people have a diffuse preference for a certain direction of policy-making and that people vary in the intensity with which they hold those preferences. We test the two competing theories at the individual level with National Election Study data and find the directional theory more strongly supported than the traditional spatial theory. We then develop the implications of the directional theory for candidate behavior and assess the predictions in light of evidence from the U.S. Congress},

We interviewed a random sample of residents in the town of Center Moriches and in the surrounding county of Suffolk, New York, before and after the decision. Consistent with the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion (Petty and Cacioppo 1986), we find that high levels of information about the decision increases support for the Court's decision among those for whom the decision is relatively less salient},

Our results show that selective voters constitute the bulk of the electorate.

abstract = {An enduring and increasingly acute concern—in an age of polarized parties—is that people's partisan attachments distort preference formation at the expense of relevant information. For example, research suggests that a Democrat may support a policy proposed by Democrats, but oppose the same policy if proposed by Republicans. However, a related body of literature suggests that how people respond to information and form preferences is distorted by their prior issue attitudes. In neither instance is information even-handedly evaluated, rather, it is interpreted in light of partisanship or existing issue opinions. Both effects are well documented in isolation, but in most political scenarios individuals consider both partisanship and prior opinions—yet, these dynamics may or may not pull toward the same preference. Using nationally representative experiments focused on tax and education policies, I introduce and test a theory that isolates when: partisanship dominates preference formation, partisanship and issue opinions reinforce or offset each other, and issue attitudes trump partisanship. The findings make clear that the public does not blindly follow party elites. Depending on elite positions, the level of partisan polarization, and personal importance of issues, the public can be attentive to information and shirk the influence of party elites. The results have broad implications for political parties and citizen competence in contemporary democratic politics},

Individuals who consider that an issue is important are more likely to rely on their attitudes toward that issue when evaluating candidates and deciding for whom to vote.

Incumbent performance evaluations regarding an issue should have a stronger impact on the vote choice of individuals who find that issue important. The analysis demonstrates that there is a significant interaction between performance evaluations and issue importance.

abstract = {Credit card fraud is increasing considerably with the development of modern technology and the global superhighways of communication. Credit card fraud costs consumers and the financial company billions of dollars annually, and fraudsters continuously try to find new rules and tactics to commit illegal actions. Thus, fraud detection systems have become essential for banks and financial institution, to minimize their losses. However, there is a lack of published literature on credit card fraud detection techniques, due to the unavailable credit card transactions dataset for researchers. The most commonly techniques used fraud detection methods are Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms (KNN). These techniques can be used alone or in collaboration using ensemble or meta-learning techniques to build classifiers. But amongst all existing method, ensemble learning methods are identified as popular and common method, not because of its quite straightforward implementation, but also due to its exceptional predictive performance on practical problems. In this paper we trained various data mining techniques used in credit card fraud detection and evaluate each methodology based on certain design criteria. After several trial and comparisons; we introduced the bagging classifier based on decision three, as the best classifier to construct the fraud detection model. The performance evaluation is performed on real life credit card transactions dataset to demonstrate the benefit of the bagging ensemble algorithm.},

We demonstrate that these findings are manifestations of measurement error associated with individual survey items. First, we show that averaging a large number of survey items on the same broadly defined issue area—–for example, government involvement in the economy, or moral issues—–eliminates a large amount of measurement error and reveals issue preferences that are well structured and stable. This stability increases steadily as the number of survey items increases and can approach that of party identification. Second, we show that once measurement error has been reduced through the use of multiple measures, issue preferences have much greater explanatory power in models of presidential vote choice, again approaching that of party identification.},

The most common measure, a count of the number of initiatives on the ballot, is incomplete, because it unrealistically assumes that all propositions have an equal impact on turnout and focuses exclusively on initiatives. These deficiencies are addressed by looking at the issue content of all ballot measures. I find that the number of social issues on the ballot, because they are highly salient, tap into existing social cleavages, help to overcome barriers to voting, and fit within a framework of expressive choice, had a positive impact on turnout for all midterm and some presidential elections since 1992. In contrast to previous findings, however, the total number of propositions on the ballot was rarely associated with an increase in turnout. I discuss the implications of these findings in the conclusion.},

By applying multilevel models for growth, we find suggestive evidence for three age effects: period, aging, and cohort. While the data exhibit the expected convergence in turnout between Geneva and non-Geneva citizens over time, the results suggest that women had already caught up with men by the beginning of our study. The results are less straightforward, but not less interesting, with regard to institutional variables, which interact with age, but not with sex or citizenship status.},

Five interrelated techniques are analyzed: the development of voter management databases; the integration of personal data from commercial data brokerage firms; micro-targeting; the decentralization of data to local campaigns; and targeted sharing through social media. Structural and cultural differences between the United States and other democratic countries prevent the extensive and direct export of many of these practices. Yet issues about inappropriate communication from parties, about the sharing of data across systems, about intrusive uses of the Internet and social media, and about data breaches have surfaced in some countries. Furthermore, trends in Western party systems towards a greater de-alignment of the electorate will surely place further pressures on parties to target voters outside their traditional bases, and to find new, cheaper, and potentially more intrusive, ways to influence their political behavior. Voter surveillance requires further comparative analysis, from a variety of disciplinary perspectives. The issues are not confined to the privacy of the individual voter, but relate to broader trends in democratic politics.},

abstract = {This paper presents a review of - and classification scheme for - the literature on the application of data mining techniques for the detection of financial fraud. Although financial fraud detection (FFD) is an emerging topic of great importance, a comprehensive literature review of the subject has yet to be carried out. This paper thus represents the first systematic, identifiable and comprehensive academic literature review of the data mining techniques that have been applied to FFD. 49 journal articles on the subject published between 1997 and 2008 was analyzed and classified into four categories of financial fraud (bank fraud, insurance fraud, securities and commodities fraud, and other related financial fraud) and six classes of data mining techniques (classification, regression, clustering, prediction, outlier detection, and visualization). The findings of this review clearly show that data mining techniques have been applied most extensively to the detection of insurance fraud, although corporate fraud and credit card fraud have also attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. In contrast, we find a distinct lack of research on mortgage fraud, money laundering, and securities and commodities fraud. The main data mining techniques used for FFD are logistic models, neural networks, the Bayesian belief network, and decision trees, all of which provide primary solutions to the problems inherent in the detection and classification of fraudulent data. This paper also addresses the gaps between FFD and the needs of the industry to encourage additional research on neglected topics, and concludes with several suggestions for further FFD research. {\textcopyright} 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The attention of subjects to EEG-based emotion recogni- tion experiments could seriously affect their emotion induction level and annotation quality of EEG data. Therefore, it is important to evalu- ate the raw EEG data before training the classification model. In this paper, we propose a framework to filter out low quality EEG data from participants with low attention using eye tracking data and boost the performance of deep affective models with CNN and LSTM. We intro- duce a novel attention-deprived experiment with dual tasks, in which the dominant task is auditory continuous performance test, identical pairs version (CPT-IP) and the subtask is emotion eliciting experiment. Motivated by the idea that subjects with attention share similar scan- path patterns under the same clips, we adopt the cosine distance based spatial-temporal scan-path analysis with eye tracking data to cluster these similar scan-paths. The average accuracy of emotion recognition using the selected EEG data with attention is about 3{\%} higher than that of original training dataset without filtering. We also found that with the increasing distance of scan-paths between outliers and cluster center, the performance of corresponding EEG data tends to decrease.},

abstract = {A rapidly expanding empirical literature has addressed the widely accepted claim that employment- unfriendly labor market institutions explain the pattern of unemployment across countries. The main culprits are held to be protective institutions, namely unemployment benefit entitlements, employment protection laws, and trade unions. Our assessment of the evidence offers little sup- port for this orthodox view. The most compelling finding of the cross-country regression literature is the generally significant and robust effect of the standard measure of unemployment benefit gen- erosity, but there are reasons to doubt both the economic importance of this relationship and the direction of causation. The micro evidence on the effects of major changes in benefit generosity on the exit rate out of unemployment has been frequently cited as supportive evidence, but these individual level effects vary widely across studies and, in any case, have no direct implication for changes in the aggregate unemployment rate (due to composition and entitlement effects). Finally, we find little evidence to suggest that 1990s reforms of core protective labor market in- stitutions can explain much of either the success of the success stories or the continued high unemployment of the large continental European countries. We conclude that the evidence is con- sistent with a more complex reality in which a variety of labor market models can be consistent with good employment performance.},

However, the asymp-totic justification of widely employed estimation strategies presumes large samples and applications in comparative politics routinely involve only a small number of countries. Thus researchers and reviewers often wonder if these models are applicable at all. In other words, how many countries do we need for multilevel modeling? I present results from a large scale Monte Carlo experiment comparing the performance of multilevel models when few countries are available. I find that maximum likelihood estimates and confidence intervals can be severely biased, especially in models including cross-level interactions. In contrast, the Bayesian approach proves to be far more robust and yields considerably more conservative tests.},

Using their results (along with non-misstated firms) in the form of a three-class target variable, we develop three multi-class classifiers, multinomial logistic regression, support vector machine, and Bayesian networks, as predictive tools to detect and classify misstatements according to the presence of fraud intention. To deal with class imbalance and asymmetric misclassification costs, we undertake cost-sensitive learning using MetaCost. We evaluate features from previous studies of detecting fraudulent intention and material misstatements. Features such as the short interest ratio and the firm-efficiency measure show discriminatory potential. The yearly and quarterly context-based feature set created further improves the performance of the classifiers.},

abstract = {In the 2012 presidential election, the major candidates and political parties assembled extraordinarily detailed political dossiers on every American voter. These dossiers allowed them to target voters based on the likelihood of their registering to vote, supporting a candidate, donating to a campaign, or casting a ballot on Election Day. Despite this pervasive use of big data techniques, the privacy implications of data-driven campaigning have not been thoroughly explored, much less regulated. This Article suggests that political dossiers may be the largest unregulated assemblage of personal data in contemporary American life. It analyzes the main sources of voter data and the absence of privacy laws regulating the collection and use of such data. It also explores the potential privacy harms of voter microtargeting under the twin rubrics of information privacy (control over personal information) and political privacy (the personal sphere necessary for democratic deliberation and self-determination). This Article advocates a modest proposal for addressing these harms, which has two components. The first is a mandatory disclosure and disclaimer regime requiring political actors to be more transparent about their use of voter microtargeting and related campaign data practices. The second is the enactment of new federal privacy restrictions on commercial data brokers that would equally apply to firms providing data consulting services to political campaigns. This proposal is necessarily modest because it operates in the shadow of the First Amendment. The Article concludes by defending both components of the proposal},

Today, therefore, companies try to take advantage of digital marketing channels to provide suitable services to customers to improve their satisfaction level. However, this study aimed to identify and assess factors affecting skill gap in digital marketing. This was descriptive correlation study. The population consisted of experts in communications industry to identify most important skill gaps in digital marketing and factors affecting them; also, managers and specialists of these companies were investigated to determine the role of identified factors in reducing skills gaps. Using localized questionnaire and interviewing with ten experts who were selected by Delphi snowball method, the skill gaps in marketing and factors affecting them were identified. Also, a researcher made questionnaire with 32 questions was distributed among 226 employees to investigate the identified factors role in reducing skills gap in digital marketing. The results showed that from four identified factors, the components including operational strategic factors and environmental factors had direct and positive impact on creating skill gap in digital marketing of studied companies. The environmental factors such as social and cultural conditions, religion, technology, and economy had more proactive impact on skills gap in digital marketing. Also, the results showed that among skills gaps in digital marketing of studied companies, the skills (Principles of Communication) and (Predicting Future) had the highest and lowest gaps, respectively.

These formulations are used to separate the normal data from anomalous data. Various techniques based on these formulations have been analyzed in terms of a number of characteristics for harsh environments. These characteristics include input data type, spatio-temporal and attribute correlations, user specified thresholds, outlier types, outlier identification(event/error), outlier degree, susceptibility to dynamic topology, non-stationarity and inhomogeneity. A tabular description of improvement and feasibility of various techniques for deployment in the harsh environments has also been presented. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.},

abstract = {An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a software application or device that monitors the system or activities of network for policy violations or malicious activities and generates reports to the management system. A number of systems may try to prevent an intrusion attempt but this is neither required nor expected of a monitoring system. The main focus of Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) is to identify the possible incidents, logging information about them and in report attempts. In addition, organizations use IDPS for other purposes, like identifying problems with security policies, deterring individuals and documenting existing threats from infringing security policies. IDPS have become an essential addition to the security infrastructure of nearly every organization. Various methods can be used to detect intrusions but each one is specific to a specific method. The main goal of an intrusion detection system is to detect the attacks efficiently. Furthermore, it is equally important to detect attacks at a beginning stage in order to reduce their impacts. This research work proposed a new approach called outlier detection where, the anomaly dataset is measured by the Neighborhood Outlier Factor (NOF). Here, trained model consists of big datasets with distributed storage environment for improving the performance of Intrusion Detection system. The experimental results proved that the proposed approach identifies the anomalies very effectively than any other approaches.},

abstract = {Background: Heatwaves have been linked to increased risk of mortality and morbidity and are projected to increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change. The current study uses emergency department (ED) data from Australia, Botswana, Netherlands, Pakistan, and the United States of America to evaluate the impact of heatwaves on ED attendances, admissions and mortality. Methods: Routinely collected time series data were obtained from 18 hospitals. Two separate thresholds ({\textgreater}=4 and {\textgreater}=7) of the acclimatisation excess heat index (EHIaccl) were used to define "hot days". Analyses included descriptive statistics, independent samples T-tests to determine differences in case mix between hot days and other days, and threshold regression to determine which temperature thresholds correspond to large increases in ED attendances. Findings: In all regions, increases in temperature that did not coincide with time to acclimatise resulted in increases in ED attendances, and the EHIaccl performed in a similar manner. During hot days in California and The Netherlands, significantly more children ended up in the ED, while in Pakistan more elderly people attended. Hot days were associated with more patient admissions in the ages 5-11 in California, 65-74 in Karachi, and 75-84 in The Hague. During hot days in The Hague, patients with psychiatric symptoms were more likely to die. The current study did not identify a threshold temperature associated with particularly large increases in ED demand. Interpretation: The association between heat and ED demand differs between regions. A limitation of the current study is that it does not consider delayed effects or influences of other environmental factors. Given the association between heat and ED use, hospitals and governmental authorities should recognise the demands that heat can place on local health care systems. These demands differ substantially between regions, with Pakistan being the most heavily affected within our study sample.},

The research includes a number of methodological advancements from earlier work on turnout and direct democracy (including a control for endogeneity) by restricting the analysis to initiative states only.

Yet, in the past 25 years, usage of direct democracy has exploded in the United States. Using pooled time series data for the 50 states over a 26-year period (1970-1996), we find that the presence and usage of the initiative process is associated with higher voter turnout in both presidential and midterm elections. The disparity in turnout rates between initiative and noninitiative states has been increasing over time, estimated at 7{\%} to 9{\%} higher in midterm and 3{\%} to 4.5{\%} higher in presidential elections in the 1990s.

The results offer no clear support for the argument that EPL is a cause of unemployment. Although EPL reaches statistical significance at conventional levels in some models, the results are sensitive to small changes in the sample or the use of alternative estimators. While the analysis suggests some scope for complementary reforms of EPL and the tax wedge in tackling youth unemployment, the findings on the whole indicate that government efforts to tackle unemployment by deregulating EPL alone may well be futile.},

abstract = {Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) has been considered as the main component of a safe network. One of the problems of these security systems is false alarm report of intrusion to the network and intrusion detection accuracy that happens due to the high volume of network data. This paper proposes a new reliable hybrid method for an anomaly network-based IDS (A-NIDS) using artificial bee colony (ABC) and AdaBoost algorithms in order to gain a high detection rate (DR) with low false positive rate (FPR). ABC algorithm is used to feature selection and AdaBoost are used to evaluate and classify the features. Results of the simulation on NSL-KDD and ISCXIDS2012 datasets confirm that this reliable hybrid method has a significant difference from other IDS, which are accomplished according to the same dataset. It has demonstrated differently better performance in different attacks-based scenarios. The accuracy and detection rate of this method has been improved in comparison with legendary methods.},

abstract = {We are seeing an enormous increase in the availability of streaming, time-series data. Largely driven by the rise of connected real-time data sources, this data presents technical challenges and opportunities. One fundamental capability for streaming analytics is to model each stream in an unsupervised fashion and detect unusual, anomalous behaviors in real-time. Early anomaly detection is valuable, yet it can be difficult to execute reliably in practice. Application constraints require systems to process data in real-time, not batches. Streaming data inherently exhibits concept drift, favoring algorithms that learn continuously. Furthermore, the massive number of independent streams in practice requires that anomaly detectors be fully automated. In this paper we propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm that meets these constraints. The technique is based on an online sequence memory algorithm called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). We also present results using the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), a benchmark containing real-world data streams with labeled anomalies. The benchmark, the first of its kind, provides a controlled open-source environment for testing anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. We present results and analysis for a wide range of algorithms on this benchmark, and discuss future challenges for the emerging field of streaming analytics.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 INFORMS. We study the impact of network information for social security fraud detection. In a social security system, companies have to pay taxes to the government. This study aims to identify those companies that intentionally go bankrupt to avoid contributing their taxes. We link companies to each other through their shared resources, because some resources are the instigators of fraud. We introduce GOTCHA!, a new approach to define and extract features from a time-weighted network and to exploit and integrate network-based and intrinsic features in fraud detection. The GOTCHA! propagation algorithm diffuses fraud through the network, labeling the unknown and anticipating future fraud while simultaneously decaying the importance of past fraud. We find that domaindriven network variables have a significant impact on detecting past and future frauds and improve the baseline by detecting up to 55{\%} additional fraudsters over time.},

abstract = {As state policy activism has flourished in recent years, increasingly that activism has taken place through the direct democracy process. While winning ballot measures often have implications for federal-state relations, federalism issues have largely been ignored in the direct democracy literature. I address this oversight by investigating how the outcomes of direct democracy politics affect the relationships among citizens, states, and the federal government. My analysis focuses on measures proposed over the last decade that represent either a response to perceived federal inaction or a challenge to federal policy. The findings suggest that initiatives have different effects on federal-state relations depending on the form they take. When ballot measures seeking to fill a policy void lead to federal action, they promote intergovernmental policy consensus and narrow the distance between public opinion and federal policy; if the federal government fails to address the issue at stake, additional state innovation will result and voter preferences and federal policy outcomes will move farther apart. Meanwhile, initiatives that challenge federal law create conflict and polarization between states and the federal government and widen the distance between public opinion and federal policy. The passage of initiatives in both categories heightens opinionpolicy congruence at the state level as officials are often eager to publicly support and implement the results of successful ballot measures.},

While e-commerce is still gaining popularity, it is also the playground of fraudsters who try to misuse the transparency of online purchases and the transfer of credit card records. This paper proposes APATE, a novel approach to detect fraudulent credit card transactions conducted in online stores. Our approach combines (1) intrinsic features derived from the characteristics of incoming transactions and the customer spending history using the fundamentals of RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary); and (2) network-based features by exploiting the network of credit card holders and merchants and deriving a time-dependent suspiciousness score for each network object. Our results show that both intrinsic and network-based features are two strongly intertwined sides of the same picture. The combination of these two types of features leads to the best performing models which reach AUC-scores higher than 0.98.},

abstract = {To quantify the fundamental evolution of time-varying networks, and detect abnormal behavior, one needs a notion of temporal difference that captures significant organizational changes between two successive instants. In this work, we propose a family of distances that can be tuned to quantify structural changes occurring on a graph at different scales: from the local scale formed by the neighbors of each vertex, to the largest scale that quantifies the connections between clusters, or communities. Our approach results in the definition of a true distance, and not merely a notion of similarity. We propose fast (linear in the number of edges) randomized algorithms that can quickly compute an approximation to the graph metric. The third contribution involves a fast algorithm to increase the robustness of a network by optimally decreasing the Kirchhoff index. Finally, we conduct several experiments on synthetic graphs and real networks, and we demonstrate that we can detect configurational changes that are directly related to the hidden variables governing the evolution of dynamic networks.},

Using Federal Election Commission and LinkedIn data, we trace the professional biographies of staffers (N = 629) working in technology, digital, data, or analytics on primary and general election presidential campaigns during this period. We found uneven professionalization in these areas, defined in terms of staffers moving from campaign to campaign or from political organizations to campaigns, with high rates of new entrants to the field. Democrats had considerably greater numbers of staffers in the areas of technology, digital, data, and analytics and from the technology industry, and much higher rates of organizational founding.

Using national surveys and advances in opinion estimation, we create new estimates of state-level support for eight policies, including civil unions and nondiscrimination laws. We differentiate between responsiveness to opinion and congruence with opinion majorities. We find a high degree of responsiveness, controlling for interest group pressure and the ideology of voters and elected officials. Policy salience strongly increases the influence of policy-specific opinion (directly and relative to general voter ideology). There is, however, a surprising amount of noncongruence—for some policies, even clear supermajority support seems insufficient for adoption. When noncongruent, policy tends to be more conservative than desired by voters; that is, there is little progay policy bias. We find little to no evidence that state political institutions affect policy responsiveness or congruence.},

abstract = {Due to the growing volume of electronic payments, the monetary strain of credit-card fraud is turning into a substantial challenge for financial institutions and service providers, thus forcing them to continuously improve their fraud detection systems. However, modern data-driven and learning-based methods, despite their popularity in other domains, only slowly find their way into business applications. In this paper, we phrase the fraud detection problem as a sequence classification task and employ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to incorporate transaction sequences. We also integrate state-of-the-art feature aggregation strategies and report our results by means of traditional retrieval metrics. A comparison to a baseline random forest (RF) classifier showed that the LSTM improves detection accuracy on offline transactions where the card-holder is physically present at a merchant. Both the sequential and non-sequential learning approaches benefit strongly from manual feature aggregation strategies. A subsequent analysis of true positives revealed that both approaches tend to detect different frauds, which suggests a combination of the two. We conclude our study with a discussion on both practical and scientific challenges that remain unsolved.},
